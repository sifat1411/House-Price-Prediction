# House-Price-Prediction

Welcome to the House Price Prediction Project, a part of my internship at Bharat Intern. In this project, I've utilized advanced data science techniques to predict house prices based on real estate data. This README provides an overview of the project and how to navigate the repository.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices using a dataset of various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. By analyzing and understanding the relationships between these features and actual sale prices, I aimed to create a robust model for predicting house prices.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Includes Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `models/`: Contains trained machine learning models.
- `src/`: Houses source code and utility scripts for data processing and model evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To explore this project and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to explore the Jupyter notebooks.
4. Run the preprocessing notebook to clean and prepare the dataset.
5. Train and evaluate the predictive model using the provided notebooks.

Feel free to customize the code and experiment with different algorithms and parameters to enhance the predictive performance.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to Bharat Intern for providing me with the opportunity to work on this engaging project and gain hands-on experience in data science. The journey of predicting house prices has been both challenging and rewarding, and I'm excited to have reached this milestone.
